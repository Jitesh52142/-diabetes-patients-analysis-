# Diabetes Patients Analysis

## Project Description

This project is focused on the analysis and prediction of diabetes progression among patients, developed using Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes various patient features such as age, BMI, and blood pressure to analyze and predict the likelihood of diabetes progression.

## Learning

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing medical data for analysis and predictive modeling.
- **Predictive Models**: Application of various algorithms to analyze and predict diabetes progression based on patient data.

## Achievements

- **Accurate Predictions**: Successfully built and trained models that provide accurate predictions of diabetes progression.
- **Feature Importance**: Identified and analyzed key factors that influence diabetes progression.

## Impact

- **Improved Patient Care**: Helps healthcare providers predict and manage diabetes progression, leading to better patient outcomes.
- **Educational Tool**: Serves as a resource for learning about data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and feature analysis in medical data.
